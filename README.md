## My first Django app:

A personal code sharing repository/site.

On top of wanting to hone my Django/Python skills, I was looking way to put syntax-highlighted code on my ExpressionEngine(2.0)-powered website (currently, EE2 does not have a syntax highlighter add-on available.)

## Inspiration:

Cobbled together from these projects:

* [philgyford / practical-django-projects](http://bitbucket.org/philgyford/practical-django-projects/src)
* [bartTC / django-paste ](https://github.com/bartTC/django-paste)

… and this book:

[Practical Django Projects, Second Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Django-Projects-Experts-Development/dp/1430219386)

## Dependencies:

It has been several months since I last touched this code, but from what I can remember:

1. [Django-piston](http://bitbucket.org/jespern/django-piston/wiki/Home)
2. [Pygments](http://pygments.org/)
3. [Markdown](http://www.freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/)
4. [Dateutil](http://labix.org/python-dateutil)

## Warning:

I am far from a pro Django coder, so be warned.

I did put some hours into this project, and I think the code could be helpful to others… For example:

* Jquery plugin for embedding code snippets on other sites.
* Use of Piston for API.
* Overall simplicity of app (compared to others).

## Other notes:

* This project was created on [WebFaction](http://www.webfaction.com/), so the folder structure mimics the WebFaction user setup.
* I used mod-wsgi.
* Sorry if not packaged properly… Anyway, I don't even think this code is worth packaging. :D
* I put all my assets (css/images/other…) on a different server.
